    level: 'A1→A2',
    category: 'grammar',
    learningGoal: 'The student will master the Present Simple to express routines, habits, and universal truths, including the third person rule.',
    explanation: `The Present Simple is the most basic and frequent tense. It's used for habitual actions, general facts, and universal truths.

**Main uses:**
1. **Routines and habits:** I wake up at 7 AM.
2. **General facts:** Water boils at 100°C.
3. **Fixed schedules:** The train leaves at 9 PM.
4. **Permanent states:** She lives in Paris.

**Formation:**
| Subject | Verb |
|---------|------|
| I/You/We/They | base verb (work) |
| He/She/It | verb + s/es (works) |

**Third person rule (he/she/it):**
• General: add -S → work**s**, play**s**
• Verbs in -ch, -sh, -ss, -x, -o: add -ES → watch**es**, go**es**
• Consonant + Y: change Y to -IES → study → stud**ies**
• Vowel + Y: just -S → play**s**

**Negative:**
• I/You/We/They + **don't** + verb
• He/She/It + **doesn't** + verb (no -s!)

**Question:**
• **Do** + I/you/we/they + verb?
• **Does** + he/she/it + verb? (no -s!)

**Adverbs of frequency:**
always > usually > often > sometimes > rarely > never
Position: before the verb (after 'be')
• "I always drink coffee." / "She is always happy."`,
    examples: [
      { english: "She works in a hospital.", context: "Third person + s" },
      { english: "I don't like vegetables.", context: "Negative with don't" },

    commonMistakes: [
      { mistake: "She work every day.", correction: "She works every day.", why: "With he/she/it, the verb ALWAYS takes -s." },

      { mistake: "Does she works here?", correction: "Does she work here?", why: "After 'does', the verb has no -s." },
      { mistake: "I drink always coffee.", correction: "I always drink coffee.", why: "The adverb goes before the main verb." }

    level: 'A1→A2',
    category: 'grammar',
    learningGoal: 'The student will use the Present Continuous to describe actions happening right now or during this period.',
    explanation: `The Present Continuous (also called Present Progressive) describes actions in progress at the moment of speaking.

**Structure:**
Subject + AM/IS/ARE + verb-ING

| Subject | To Be | Verb+ING |
|---------|-------|----------|
| I | am | working |
| He/She/It | is | working |
| You/We/They | are | working |

**Rules for forming -ING:**
• General: add -ING → work**ing**
• Ends in -E: drop E, add -ING → mak**e** → mak**ing**
• CVC (consonant-vowel-consonant): double last consonant → run → run**n**ing
• Ends in -IE: change to -YING → die → d**ying**

**Uses:**
1. **Actions now:** "I'm studying English right now."
2. **Temporary actions:** "She's living in London this month."
3. **Future plans:** "We're meeting tomorrow at 5."
4. **Changes/trends:** "Technology is changing rapidly."

**Key words:**
now, right now, at the moment, currently, this week/month, today

**Negative:** Subject + am/is/are + NOT + verb-ing
**Question:** Am/Is/Are + subject + verb-ing?

**⚠️ Stative Verbs (don't use -ing):**
love, hate, like, want, need, know, understand, believe, see, hear, have (possession)`,

    learningGoal: 'The student will use the Past Simple with regular and common irregular verbs to describe completed actions in the past.',
    explanation: `The Past Simple is used for actions completed at a specific time in the past.

**Regular verbs:**
Add -ED to the base verb
• work → work**ed**
• play → play**ed**
• study → studi**ed** (consonant+Y → -IED)
• live → liv**ed** (-E → just add -D)

    learningGoal: 'The student will distinguish when to use Past Simple (specific moment) vs Present Perfect (connection to present).',
    explanation: `This is one of the most difficult differences for learners. Understand it well to sound natural.

**PAST SIMPLE:**
Complete actions at a SPECIFIC moment in the past.
• "I **visited** Paris in 2019." (specific moment: 2019)
• "She **graduated** last year." (specific moment: last year)

**Key words:**
yesterday, last week/month/year, in 2020, ago, when I was young

**PRESENT PERFECT:**
Past actions with CONNECTION to the present (no specific time).
• "I **have visited** Paris." (life experience - doesn't matter when)
• "She **has graduated**." (relevant result now)

**Key words:**
ever, never, already, yet, just, recently, so far, since, for

**KEY RULE:**
• When? → PAST SIMPLE
• Have you ever done this? → PRESENT PERFECT

**Direct comparison:**
| Present Perfect | Past Simple |
|-----------------|-------------|
| I've been to London. (experience) | I went to London in 2018. (when) |
| Have you ever tried sushi? | Did you try sushi last night? |
| She has just arrived. (just now) | She arrived an hour ago. (when) |

**Present Perfect structure:**
have/has + past participle
• I/You/We/They have worked
• He/She/It has worked

**Present Perfect uses:**
1. **Experiences:** "I have never seen snow."
2. **Recent actions:** "She has just finished."
3. **Continuing actions:** "I have lived here for 5 years."
4. **Changes:** "He has lost weight."`,

**ZERO CONDITIONAL (general truths):**
If + present simple, present simple
• "If you heat water to 100°C, it boils."
• Use: Scientific facts, universal truths

**FIRST CONDITIONAL (probable situations):**
If + present simple, will + verb

• Use: Real and probable future situations

**SECOND CONDITIONAL (hypothetical present situations):**
If + past simple, would + verb

• Use: Unreal or unlikely situations

**THIRD CONDITIONAL (unreal past situations):**

• Use: Regrets, speculating about the past

**MIXED CONDITIONALS:**

• "If I had taken that job, I would be rich now."

General condition → past result:
If + past simple, would have + past participle
• "If I were more careful, I wouldn't have made that mistake."

  // Article 86: Nominalization
  {
    id: 'gram-nominalization',
    title: 'Grammar: Nominalization',
    level: 'B2→C1',
    category: 'grammar',
    learningGoal: 'The student will transform verbs and adjectives into nouns for a more formal and academic style.',
    explanation: `Nominalization is converting verbs/adjectives into nouns. It's key for academic and formal writing.

**What is nominalization?**
Changing: "They implemented the policy" (verb)
To: "The implementation of the policy" (noun)

**Why nominalize?**
• Sounds more formal and academic
• Allows denser information in sentences
• Characteristic of academic and professional English

**Common nominalization suffixes:**

**From verbs:**
| Verb | Noun |
|------|------|
| decide | decision (-sion) |
| develop | development (-ment) |
| analyze | analysis (-sis) |
| apply | application (-tion) |
| discover | discovery (-ry) |
| fail | failure (-ure) |
| arrive | arrival (-al) |

**From adjectives:**
| Adjective | Noun |
|-----------|------|
| important | importance (-ance) |
| different | difference (-ence) |
| able | ability (-ity) |
| happy | happiness (-ness) |
| free | freedom (-dom) |

**Transformation examples:**

Informal: "They decided to reduce costs."
Formal: "The decision to implement cost reduction..."

Informal: "We need to develop new products quickly."
Formal: "The rapid development of new products is necessary."

**Useful patterns:**
• The + noun + of + noun: "The implementation of the strategy"
• Due to + noun: "Due to the complexity of the issue"
• The + adjective + noun: "The rapid development"`,
    examples: [
      { english: "The implementation of new policies requires careful planning.", context: "Formal writing" },
      { english: "Their discovery of the virus led to a breakthrough.", context: "Academic style" },
      { english: "The government's failure to act caused widespread criticism.", context: "News style" },
      { english: "The importance of education cannot be overstated.", context: "Adjective → noun" }
    ],
    commonMistakes: [
      { mistake: "The way they implement policies is important.", correction: "The implementation of policies is important.", why: "Nominalization is more formal and concise." },
      { mistake: "How they decided affected the outcome.", correction: "Their decision affected the outcome.", why: "Using the noun form is more sophisticated." }

      "Identify verbs in sentences and nominalize them.",
